# WindChaser
This is the DIRECT Project page for WindChaser group. This package is developed for wind power forecasting along with wind energy economic dispatch with a combination of LSTM and Q-Learning. The package was built and developed by wind data from wind farms in Seattle, WA. A GUI implementation for visualizing real-time forecasts is also available.

### Data
Contains the raw data downloaded from <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/">`NREL`</a>. It also contains the processed data under the same directory that we used for machine learning algorithm in this project.

### Docs
Documentations about this project. This includes stand-up presentations, find poster and detailed API user documentation.

### GUI demo
The GUI created by `Matlab` shows the curve of the history ground truth of the wind power  as well as the prediction curve obtained from `LSTM` method of machine learning that we used in this project. Both the prediction and history power outages can be seen from the dashboard of this GUI.


### Graphs
The graph module includes all the workflow plot as well as data processing and analysis, LSTM forecasts, Q learning for decision making results.

### WindChaserModule
Main part of this project. Contains all python and Matlab packages, code and modules of machine learning method to implement the wind energy prediction.
